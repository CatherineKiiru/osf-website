            <p className="text-base my-4">
              Sustain Africa is a one-day conversation for Open Source Software Sustainers. We would be talking about
              Sustainability - the sustainability of resources and the sustainability of its people. The conversation
              around the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized, and providing a roadmap
              for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open source project maintainers
              continues to be the focus of Sustain.
              <br />
              <br />
              At the Sustain Africa summit, there would be no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos. Your undivided
              attention will be required. Phones and laptops will not be used throughout, and you will be asked to put
              devices away if they are a distraction to you or anyone else, as facilitators take you through the journey
              of Open Source Sustainability.

              The following are some general guidelines regarding how we will run the event:

                <b>Full participation in the program is requested: </b>
                part-time participation will work against the overall event goals. In particular, we ask all
                participants to refrain from scheduling side meetings during stated agenda times. We ask that each
                participant utilize their seat at the meeting to the fullest for the benefit of all.

              <li className="m-4">
                <b>This is a &quot;devices at ease&quot; event: </b>
                use of laptops and cellphones during sessions is strongly discouraged unless you are a designated
                note-taker. We encourage all participants to be fully present in sessions and discussions, rather than
                multi-tasking on email, etc. We invite participants to use the break to check in with external
                realities.
              </li>
              <li className="m-4">
                <b>Note: </b>
                will be dynamically captured during sessions, as we want to document and disseminate the learnings and
                outcomes from the event and create resources we can continue to build upon. We will be asking all
                participants to help with capture, so as to spread the work around evenly.

              Sessions are designed to be highly interactive. This won’t be a space where you will see any panels and
              keynote speakers. Breakout sessions will be designed to spur discussion and production. Facilitators will
              have as their primary goals enabling learning, addressing questions, and supporting peer sharing and peer
              production. Bring your ideas, your questions, your needs and your knowledge to share!

              activities. Sessions will be dialog and outcome-oriented rather than presentations or lecture format. The
              program is envisioned to enable deeper collaborations and learnings across the network of participants in
